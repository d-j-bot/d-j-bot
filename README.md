# About me
I come from Uganda, and I'm currently living in Kenya.


**d-j-bot/d-j-bot** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...the Boss Workshop
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to edit text in README
- 💬 Ask me about ...travelling 🏖 ⛰
- 😄 Pronouns: ...they/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I support Chelsea FC
